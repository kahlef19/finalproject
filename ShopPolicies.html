<p>We can almost customize all of our listings for your needs! Let us know by message.</p>

<h4>Sizing details</h4>
<p>You can find our size charts on every listing.</p>

<h4>Care instructions</h4>
<p>We recommend washing your garments inside out with similar colors. Do not dry clean. Don't attempt to iron the design, it will definitely damage it and we don't want that!</P>

<h4>Bulk Orders</h4>
<p>We do bulk orders almost all the time. Reach out to us so we can give you a private quote. A lot of the bulk pricing can change depending on our workflow, material and the quantity.</p>

<h4>Custom and personalized orders</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, due to the nature of our business, we can't accept or exchange because all of our orders are custom-made.</p> </td>
